# ## Overview of Ants
#
# This model explores the behavior of ant colonies in collecting food and communicating using 
# chemicals that individual ants leave in the world. 
#
# AntWorld has one nest and three sources of food at varying distances from the nest.
# Each ant has the tendency to keep moving in the direction they are currently facing,
# with some randomness. They will follow pheromone trails to food. This pheromone trail dissipates (spreads)
# to surrounding areas. It also evaporates over time. 

# In addition, they have a chemical trail to follow back to the nest. This trail is static. 
#
# Ants set out from the nest in a random manner, seeking out sources of food. 
# When they find food, they pick up one unit of it, turn around, and head back to the nest while depositing
# pheromones for other ants to find and follow back to the food. 

# ## Defining the ant type

# `Ant` has three values (other than the required
# `id` and `pos` for any agent that lives on a [`GridSpaceSingle`](@ref)). 
# Each ant has a `has_food` attribute, showing if the ant is currently carrying food, 
# a `facing_direction` (a number between 1 and 8) describing the direction they are heading,
# and a `food_collected` which is the amount of food an individual ant has collected.

#

# 
# It starts by setting the random number generator's seed. 
# Then, it calculates the furthest distance possible an agent could be from another point 
# in the world, for normalization purposes. 
# It then calculates the center of the grid. 
# 
# Then it initializes matrices for the nest location, pheromone trails, amounts of food, and food source numbers. 
# These are the same dimensions as AntWorld grid and are standard Julia arrays.
# 
# Next it establishes the center positions of each food source. 
# Now we iterate over all the positions in the grid and set values in the corresponding
# Julia array which is then sent to the model properties. 
# The model properties is then used to create the model and subsequently the Ants (agents) are 
# created.

# ### Diffuse
# 
# Diffuse is the method used by the world to spread the pheromone chemicals to adjacent cells.

# 
# The function to perform the ant steps. It is split into two main branches - does the `Ant` have food or not. \

# nest location, then it determines the best way back to the nest. Finally it lays down some pheromone. \
# If the `Ant` doesn't have food, but it is at a food location, it picks up food and turns around. If it's not at a food
# location, it tries to follow a pheromone trail to food. \
# Then it applies a wiggle (random search if without food) and then moves the agent.
