# Agents.jl Example Zoo
This repository hosts built and run examples of models written in Agents.jl.
It contains most run examples that are not hosted on the main documentation of Agents.jl to make that documentation more concise and faster to build.

* Agents.jl docs: https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/
* Zoo of Examples: https://juliadynamics.github.io/AgentsExampleZoo.jl/dev/

### Contributing a new example
The setup of the repository uses Literate.jl. If you are unfamiliar with it, it is worth taking a look at its documentation. Alternatively, have a look at existing examples source code in `docs/examples`.
